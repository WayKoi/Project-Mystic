Re make CardAI

Make the campfire more balanced, the amount of health it gives needs to be lowered the further the player is in the dungeon
Remake the enemy choosing system and remove the event system
add variable cost stone effects (plannable UpdateValues)

Add rare rooms
Make alternate floors possible
Travelling merchant

Fill the summon table
Revamp the colour system to use arbitrary characters values like 20000, 20001 etc.
Revamp the fusion system to be base type based instead of manually enetering it

Room types
	Library room
		allows the player to trade in a card for one of the same type paying 10 + difference in card prices
		This allows for players to downgrade their spells to a playable level (if they dont have enough mana to play it)
			and get summons or rid of overload on cards more easily
	Market Room
		Auto enter, disappears when leaving
		contains all shops + some other special ones
			shop for enchanting gear
				make sure to hint at the player that enchanting the wand is a good idea
			Paid fusion of cards
			Altar
			Big card shop (open 4 packs?)
			Big Pack Shop (5-6 packs?)
			Tailor ?
			Inn ?
